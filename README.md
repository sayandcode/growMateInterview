# To whoever evaluates this
This was my first time writing React Native code. Although it was a new experience, I was able to draw many parallels between ReactJS and Native(such as React Navigation and React Router DOM). This was one big sprint, to learn the concepts and implement the correct designs. The fact that the styling language is a subset of CSS is very evident, as many features such as object-position are missing from the language. Still, I managed to complete the task successfully.

### One More Thing
I am still looking for the correct way to publish the app for your reviewing purposes. As of this moment, I am unable to find the right solution to this task. Hence, I request that you please oblige with any discrepencies in the format of my submission, and may send me a message regarding the correct submission format (at sayand.satish3@gmail.com, or any of my other contact links). 

Thank you for your patience.
